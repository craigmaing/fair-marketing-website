|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** | 248ms | ✅ Excellent | < 2.5s |
| **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** | 0.35 | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | < 0.1 |
| **FCP (First Contentful Paint)** | ~24ms | ✅ Excellent | < 1.8s |
| **TTFB (Time to First Byte)** | 24ms | ✅ Excellent | < 800ms |

### LCP Breakdown
- **TTFB:** 24ms (excellent server response)
- **Load Delay:** 134ms (resource discovery time)
- **Load Duration:** 6ms (very fast)
- **Render Delay:** 84ms (good rendering performance)

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Strengths ✅
1. **Blazing Fast Load Times:** LCP of 248ms is exceptional
2. **Server Response:** TTFB of 24ms indicates excellent server performance
3. **Mobile Responsive:** Site adapts well to mobile viewport (375x667)
4. **Clean Console:** No critical errors, only development-related messages
5. **Proper Font Loading:** Google Fonts loading efficiently
6. **Image Optimization:** Using WebP format from Unsplash with proper sizing

### Issues to Address ⚠️

#### 1. **High CLS Score (0.35)**
- **Issue:** Layout shifts occurring after initial render
- **Impact:** Poor user experience as content jumps around
- **Solution:**
  - Add explicit dimensions to images
  - Reserve space for dynamic content
  - Avoid inserting content above existing content

#### 2. **Render-Blocking Resources**
- CSS files blocking initial render
- Could delay FCP/LCP in slower connections
- **Solution:** Inline critical CSS or use `preload` hints

#### 3. **Large DOM Size**
- Multiple DOM manipulations detected
- Can impact performance on lower-end devices
- **Solution:** Optimize component rendering and reduce DOM nodes

#### 4. **Forced Reflows**
- JavaScript causing layout recalculations
- Can cause jank during interactions
- **Solution:** Batch DOM reads/writes, avoid layout thrashing

## 📱 Mobile Experience
