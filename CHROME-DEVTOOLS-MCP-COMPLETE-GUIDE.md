## Overview
This document comprehensively demonstrates all Chrome DevTools MCP features explored during our performance optimization and testing session.

## 1. Performance Optimization Results

### Initial Audit (Before Optimizations)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** 248ms ✅ Excellent
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** 0.35 ⚠️ Needs Improvement
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte):** 24ms ✅ Excellent

### Issues Identified
1. **Layout Shifts:** Images loading without explicit dimensions
2. **Render-blocking Resources:** CSS files delaying initial render

### Optimizations Applied
1. **Fixed CLS Issues:**
   - Added width/height attributes to all images
   - Files modified:
     - Hero.astro (1920x1080)
     - About.astro (800x600 - 2 images)
     - Services.astro (400x300 - 3 images)
     - blog.astro (1920x1080 hero, 800x450 thumbnails)

2. **Inlined Critical CSS:**
   - Added ~1KB critical CSS in Layout.astro
   - Optimized font loading with preload
   - Deferred non-critical CSS

### Final Audit (After Optimizations)
- **LCP:** 320ms ✅ Excellent (slight increase, still excellent)
- **CLS:** 0.00 ✅ Perfect Score!
- **TTFB:** 19ms ✅ Excellent
