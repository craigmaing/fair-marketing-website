## üîÑ Query Workflow

The agent queries the Astro MCP in this pattern:

### Phase 1: Initial Research
Before starting fixes, the agent queries:
1. "Astro best practices overview"
2. "Astro performance optimization"
3. "Astro accessibility guidelines"
4. "Astro SEO best practices"

### Phase 2: Issue-Specific Research
For each issue type found, query relevant docs:
- Found `<img>` tags ‚Üí Query image component usage
- Found `client:load` ‚Üí Query client directive best practices
- Missing TypeScript ‚Üí Query prop typing patterns
- Missing alt tags ‚Üí Query accessibility requirements

### Phase 3: Fix Verification
After implementing fixes:
- Query to verify the fix matches current best practices
- Confirm no deprecated patterns used
- Validate modern Astro patterns

## üìä Query Frequency

**Expected MCP Queries During Full Audit:**
- Initial research: ~10 queries
- Per-file analysis: ~2-3 queries per file
- Fix verification: ~1 query per fix type
- Final validation: ~5 queries

**Total for typical site (50 files):** ~150-200 Astro documentation queries

This ensures EVERY decision is backed by official Astro documentation!
