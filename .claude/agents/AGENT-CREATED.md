# ✅ Astro Best Practices Auditor Agent - CREATED

## 📁 Location
`.claude/agents/astro-best-practices-auditor.md`

## 🎯 What This Agent Does

This is a **custom Claude Code subagent** that systematically audits and fixes your entire Astro site using the **Astro MCP (astro-docs)** for best practice verification.

## ✅ Confirmed Features

### Uses Astro MCP Extensively
**YES!** The agent is configured to heavily use the `astro-docs` MCP server. It inherits all MCP tools from the main thread (no `tools:` field specified in frontmatter = inherit all tools).

The agent will query the Astro documentation for:
- Component best practices
- Performance optimization patterns
- Accessibility guidelines
- SEO best practices
- TypeScript patterns
- Image optimization
- Client directives
- View Transitions
- And much more...

### Configuration Format
```yaml
---
name: astro-best-practices-auditor
description: Comprehensive Astro site auditor that systematically reviews and fixes all non-best-practice code. Use when asked to audit, optimize, fix, or review Astro code for performance, accessibility, SEO, TypeScript, or code quality issues. Heavily uses the Astro MCP (astro-docs) to verify every best practice.
model: sonnet

```

**Note:** No `tools:` field = inherits ALL tools including all MCP servers (astro-docs, dataforseo, figma, etc.)
